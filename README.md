# Mopviewer
New Version of Mopviewer for my 3rd Year Project

##Current Features:
1. Enter 1 to look at Particle information
2. Enter 2 to Open Mopviewer
3. Enter any other key on main screen to exit

##Particle Information:
1. Use the left and right arrow keys to cycle between particles
2. Use 2 to exit program to main menu


#TODO:
1. Up/Down arrows to cycle through states
2. Start working on the actual Mopviewer
3. Adapt for use with large mopfile, if the reader gets updated?
